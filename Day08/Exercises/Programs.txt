Practice all programs in the examples section before solving exercise programs.

Programs : 

1.  int x = 20;
    int y = 18;
    if (x > y) {
      System.out.println("x is greater than y");

2.  int num=70;
    if( num < 100 ){

	System.out.println("number is less than 100");
    }

3.  int num=70;
	if( num < 100 ){ 
           System.out.println("number is less than 100"); 
           if(num > 50){
	      System.out.println("number is greater than 50");
	   }
	}

4.  int num=120;
    if( num < 50 ){
	    System.out.println("num is less than 50");
     }
    else {
	    System.out.println("num is greater than or equal 50");
     }

5. 	int num=1234;
	if(num <100 && num>=1) {
	  System.out.println("Its a two digit number");
	}
	else if(num <1000 && num>=100) {
	  System.out.println("Its a three digit number");
	}
	else if(num <10000 && num>=1000) {
	  System.out.println("Its a four digit number");
	}
	else if(num <100000 && num>=10000) {
	  System.out.println("Its a five digit number");			
	}
	else {
	  System.out.println("number is not between 1 & 99999");			
	}

6.  int time = 22;
    if (time < 10) {
      System.out.println("Good morning.");
    } else if (time < 20) {
      System.out.println("Good day.");
    }  else {
      System.out.println("Good evening.");
    }

7. MaxOfTwoNumbers: write a program to find the maximum of two integers(n1 = 25, n2 = 13).

8. MinOfTwoNumbers: write a program to find the minimum of two integers(n1 = 32, n2 = 23).

9. MinOfThreeNumbers: write a program to find the maximum of two integers(n1 = 5, n2 = 7, n3 = 3).

10. StudentGrade: write a program to ask the user to enter the marks obtained in 5 subjects to calculate and display the grade of student.

11. Calculator: write a program which is a menu-driven program based on simple calculation like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division according to user's choice:
	Sample O/P:
	1. Addition
	2. Subtraction
	3. Multiplication
	4. Division
	5. Exit
	
	Enter Your Choice : 1 
	Enter Two Number : 12
	13
	Result = 25.0

12. EvenOrOdd: write a program to ask the user to enter a number, to check and display whether the entered number is even or odd.

13. LeapYear: writre a program to ask the user to enter a year, to check and display whether the entered year is leap year or not.
		Note: A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). 
			  The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.
